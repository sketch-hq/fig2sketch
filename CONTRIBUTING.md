## Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project.

Contributions to this project are released to the public under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

### Did you find a bug?
Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability that affects Sketch or any application that can open .sketch or .fig files. If you find a security vulnerability that affects Sketch applications, please contact Sketch through [PLACEHOLDER]. If the security vulnerability affects other applications, please, report it through their appropriate secure channels.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a error trace or similar. If a written description is not enough to describe the problem, feel free to attach screenshots or videos explaining the problem.

## Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please consider the size of the change in order to determine the right steps to proceed:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
  This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

  **Note**: Adding a new topic to the documentation, or significantly re-writing a topic, counts as a major feature.

* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request).

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Configure and install the dependencies
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
5. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
7. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the same style guide you observe in the current source code
- Write tests
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
