This Code of Conduct is not limited to professional roles or working hours and it extends to all functions and places that are both professional and personal. 

Also, this Code of Conduct is articulated as a set of general principles as well as detailed prescriptions, but does not address all possible issues that may arise. It provides general guidelines aimed at maintaining high ethical standards, reputation and accountability within and beyond Sketch.

## Our standards

We know you love the Sketch community as much as we do, so we ask everyone involved in community efforts to take note of — and comply with — the following:

Any action that goes against a harassment-free experience for everyone is not acceptable in project maintained by Sketch. Violation of this policy, either through code contribution, code reviews, issues comments, etc.., will be addressed by Sketch and the project maintainers to guarantee that these violations are corrected or terminated. Sketch also reserves the right to take legal action, should there be a need for this.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect each other
- Provide and gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Show empathy towards other community members
- Being ethical, honest and accountable to all
- Being compassionate, honoring and acknowledging differences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, including but not limited to in relation to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ personal information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit written permission of said individual
- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

## Enforcement

We ask any participant and/or contributor to comply with this Code of Conduct and any further requests from the maintainers in case of a violation.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you observe and/or feel directly affected by any unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. For this, you can send a report to [PLACEHOLDER]. No one will be disadvantaged or prejudiced by Sketch if they report a suspected breach in good faith. All reports will be acted upon and kept confidential.

## Variations

Sketch reserves the right to vary, replace or terminate this policy without prior notice.
