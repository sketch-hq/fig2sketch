Our passion for design goes beyond pixels to reach our community. At Sketch we care deeply about supporting our beloved community in the best way possible. As part of these efforts, we have a set of house rules to help not only our Ambassadors and Advocates, but also us, to keep this community safe and welcoming.

## Our standards

We know you love the Sketch community as much as we do, so we ask everyone involved in this project to take note of — and comply with — the following, no matter their role: 

Any action that goes against a harassment-free experience for anyone is unacceptable in any project maintained by Sketch. Violation of these terms, either through code contribution, code reviews, issues comments, etc.., will be addressed by Sketch and the project maintainers to guarantee that these violations are corrected or terminated. Sketch also reserves the right to follow up with any legal procedure, should there be a need for this.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Respect each other
* Provide and gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Show empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.


## Enforcement

We ask any participant and/or contributor to comply with these guidelines and any further requests from the maintainers in case of a violation. 

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting

If you observe and/or feel directly affected by any unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. For this, you can send a report to [PLACEHOLDER].
